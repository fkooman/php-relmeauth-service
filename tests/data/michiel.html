    <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Building open technology is a responsibility towards billions of non-programmers.</em></p><p>Three years ago I quit my day job to save the web. It was a fluke opportunity, born more or less by accident from a holiday project, but I took on the challenge and made it my serious mission. I spent this time mainly working out how <a href="https://unhosted.org/">unhosted web apps</a> can work. I met some wonderful <a href="https://unhosted.org/people/">people</a> who joined, and together we created the unhosted web apps "movement". Projects like <a href="http://remotestorage.io/">remoteStorage</a>, <a href="https://5apps.com/">5apps</a>, <a href="http://sockethub.org/">sockethub</a>, <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service; Didn't Read</a>, and <a href="http://opentabs.net/">Opentabs</a> all sprang from this.</p><p>And now I will continue. I hereby increase my commitment to saving the web, by also <em>joining the <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/">Indie Web</a> movement</em>. This (indie!) blog post is about my motivation for that.</p><h2>Saving the web</h2><p>By saving the web I mean several things, but they basically amount to stopping the current trend where consumer tech is dominated by a shrinking number of big platforms. These user data platforms use the web as just a transport to connect users with a specific one of them. Instead, the web should itself be one open user data platform. If we let this trend continue then we will all have our user data on either Apple iCloud, Google Drive, Microsoft SkyDrive, or Dropbox Platform. These four platforms will not be compatible with each other, and the software tools you will be able to use will depend on which platform you have your data stored on. The task of saving the web consists of separating 1) software, 2) device, 3) hosting, and 4) content all back into independent layers.</p><p>Primarily, I would say, our task is to push the web as a universal platform that separates software choice from device hardware choice, so that one software tool (app) can be used on any hardware device. Mozilla, W3C, and Google are contributing to this by pushing the html standard forward, both in the browser and on mobile. I don't have any numbers, but I guess there must be like 100 people developing WebRTC, 100 developing CSS, etcetera, adding up to some 3-digit number, say 500 people working full-time specifically developing the html platform - let me know if you have a better estimate. These heroes are literally one in a million among the world population, but they're doing a very good job; it feels like html is making very rapid progress and standing its ground against competitors like iOS.</p><p>Second, there is the network effect of content locked up in silos. Indie Web fixes that by taking the content out of the social web silos and allowing cross-silo communication. Hugely important research for the future of consumer tech! But unlike with the html platform, the number of full-time people working specifically on Indie Web is nowhere near the number of people needed to do the job. The number of people working full-time on federated social web and Indie Web is what, 50 people in total maybe? And then, we are not even talking about full-time engineers. Many of these 50 or so pioneers are weekend heroes, who have an unrelated day job on the side, or their day-to-day will consist largely of paid gigs for clients.</p><p>And lastly, when software apps are device independent, and content is silo-independent, we are not done saving the web yet. We will still need to make sure both our software choice and our device choice stay separate from our choice of personal cloud storage. Devices are being locked to specific cloud storage vendors (think iPhone-iCloud, Android-Google Drive, and Windows Phone-SkyDrive). This is a horrible situation, and it's why we need remoteStorage: a standard, cross-origin interface to connect a user's own cloud storage with a web app that runs on their device: per-user data storage, for the web.</p><p>I am convinced that after the html platform breaks open the device platforms, and the indie web breaks open the social platforms, remoteStorage (or something that will improve on it) is the third of three things the web really needs today: Breaking open user data platforms. I'm convinced it's very important for the future of the web, but a very small percentage of the world population have assigned themselves the task of making something like remoteStorage a success. For some reason unknown to me (by now, I gave up wondering why), hardly anybody is working on per-user data storage for the web. But I know I am!</p><h2>I chose not to choose life</h2><p>Before I quit my "day job", I was working at Tuenti.com, a Spanish social network which was wildly successful. This meant kids in the street would treat you like a celebrity when they see you walk out of the office, and want to take their picture with you whenever you wear a T-shirt or a hoodie with the name of your employer on it. Working at Tuenti was not only great because people sometimes treat you like a rock star.</p><p>It was also a great place to work with some of the best engineers in Europe brought together. And working on a website that runs on a thousand servers was exciting, both because of the amazing scale and impact of your everyday tasks, and because of the originality of challenges you face, boldly going where only a few famous scalability engineers have gone before.</p><p>Some of the excellent engineers who were at Tuenti at the time are now at Google or Facebook. At university and in the industry, at least for us, making it into Google is viewed like a great honour, a bit like representing your country in the Olympics. Even knowing somebody who makes it into Google, is like if someone from your sports team makes it to the Olympics. It's the ultimate fame. We're all implicitly trying to climb a ladder, and Google is simply at the top.</p><p>Making it into Tuenti is already a career achievement, and therefore a significant odds multiplier for this, both because it acts as a pre-selection, and because it is a unique and valuable training. There are not so many places in Europe where you can work with Giga-pagehits-per-day infrastructure and be surrounded by dozens of people who are smarter than you, and the recruiters know this.</p><p>This was one of the things I had to consider when quitting my job to pursue this unsure non-profit project: I was basically giving up a valuable career. Except, I wasn't. One colleague already told me "within a year of working full-time on a free software project, you'll receive a phone call from one of the big ones." I didn't believe her at the time, but she was right: within a year, both Google and Facebook had asked me to come for an interview.</p><p>It makes sense as well in hindsight - people who lead a free software project are simply very visible. You end up talking at conferences and getting mentioned on Twitter. I'm quite an average engineer, but now at least I'm visible to recruiters, instead of being a nameless average engineer somewhere in a department at the back office of some company in some country. During the last 3 years I spent all my savings on the project, and only took just enough money to get by from the donations pot. But because of this visibility, I could now probably get a much better paid job than three years ago, if I wanted to. In a way, quitting my career was the best career move I ever made!</p><p>A lot of people who work on a free software project, do end up getting recruited that way. The logical next step for me, after three years of working for the cause, would be to get a nice job again somewhere. In fact, in terms of job comfort, I would <em>like</em> to do that. I like being an employee in a good team. I like being a cog. Right now, I see myself more as a projectile than as a cog. :)</p><p>Being a projectile is stressful and often hard. PhD students know this, for instance. You become a world-level expert in some tiny topic, which is amazingly exciting in some ways, but in practice, you also find out nobody will probably ever read your thesis, so you also have to learn to self-motivate, and that is fucking hard. What I didn't know when I started, is that trying to save the web is fucking hard in that same way. You have to self-motivate and stubbornly believe that where you are going is where your virtual shareholders (namely, all the future users of the web), want you to go. Being a cog in the machine is much more mindless, and therefore much more comfortable.</p><p>Still, I declined the interview offers. It would indeed have been a dream come true to go work among all these famous smart people, form a part of their team, and earn lots of money at the same time. Most friends told me I should at least have gone to California to do the interviews, if only to get a look "inside the temple". But I didn't, because saving the web is more important.</p><p>The obvious solution to this friction between personal mission and job comfort is to aim for the promised land, as I call it. In my case, the promised land would be Mozilla. People there have the professional comfort of being part of something bigger, yet they still get to work on saving the web. Also, unlike most other "you-made-it-to-the-Olympics" employers, Mozilla doesn't force you to move to some horrible suburban (silicon) valley which I heard is populated primarily by SUVs. And you get to work with all these awesome Mozillians, who are not only smart as engineers, but who also understand the importance open technology. Mozillians are double awesome in that way, and Mozilla is full of them! I imagine working there would be amazing.</p><p>In your case, the promised land might be Canonical, RedHat, Spotify (arguably), or Joyent (getting paid to work on Node), etcetera. Having a job again would definitely help me fit into polite society better. I could still be doing something just as valuable, or maybe even more valuable, for humanity. In fact, if the goal is doing what I'm good at (or in my case, what I'm average at), with maximum impact on humanity, I should probably move to New York and become a web developer for <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/">charity:water</a> (do follow that link if you haven't heard about charity:water yet).</p><p>But despite the fact that being a projectile on an underfunded rogue project is fucking hard, something is holding me back from sending my CV to the promised land or to charity:water just yet. Partially, being outside my professional comfort zone is an adventure; it is exciting because I never know what's going to happen next. It is a "life hack" that allows me the freedom to travel and be my own boss. It makes me feel like I didn't grow up yet. I like to think of myself as being about 10 years retarded, and I like to keep it that way, because I still have a hell of a lot of time left in my life for getting old, repaying a mortgage, and rotting away at the end of it all. Choose a job? In the words of Trainspotting, I chose not to choose life. I chose something else. It's uncomfortable and Bohemian, but it's also bloody exciting!</p><h2>Is there a doctor on board?</h2><p>There is another, more important reason why I said no to the headhunters, it's not just about adventure versus comfort. If my only goal would be to live an exciting and interesting life then I would quit programming right now (as I said, I'm quite average at it anyway) and become a musician. And if I saw enough people worldwide already working on saving the web, then I probably would. I would rest assured that the web is going to be just fine, and make fine sweet music instead for the rest of my days. But there aren't. Way too few people are working on this for me to also leave.</p><p>I realize that this planet is organized by the personal goals of people, the commercial goals of companies, and the political goals of politicians, but still, shouldn't more people be working on saving the web? Nobody denies the importance of web and mobile technology as tools for homo sapiens. And nobody denies that it's bad that users are being ushered into a small number of incompatible silos. I would expect the amount of effort spent to try to save the web to be smaller than the effort spent on warfare, or on selling soft drinks, or on producing TV shows. But I think 1/1000th of a percent of the world population (about 70,000 people) would not be too much to ask for, given the importance and the urgency.</p><p>And now here's the thing: We are <em>less than a handful of people</em> working full-time on remoteStorage, whichever way you count. <a href="http://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a>, <a href="http://nimbusbase.com/">NimbusBase</a>, <a href="http://hood.ie/">Hoodie</a>, <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a> and a few other projects are all similar to remoteStorage in some way, but as far as I know, remoteStorage is the only project in the world that is aiming to create per-user data storage for the web. That is positively crazy and scary at the same time.</p><p>We are such a small percentage of the world population working on such important stuff. Right? Where are those other 69,000 engineers we need to develop the html platform, the indie web platform, and the user data web properly on a global scale? Or am I missing something here? I hope now you understand that it would be simply <em>irresponsible</em> of me to stop working on open web tech, even if I wanted to.</p><p>Maybe in the future I can imagine concluding that our goal of creating "a user data web" is impossible to reach because of specific empirically proven reason X, or that the landscape changed and something else became more urgent. I know of course that saving the web is a lofty goal and that we will have to fail and restart a lot of times, but that's not a reason to give up. If anything, the opposite. When the task is challenging, then more people should try harder.</p><p>Especially if you compare it to the way Microsoft pushes SkyDrive, the way Google pushes Google Drive, and the way Apple pushes iCloud onto the consumer devices they each control. Compared to that, the open web has a hugely understaffed per-user data platform development team. Unless there is some other team somewhere whose existence I'm unaware of, on a global scale, about one in a billion people work on it.</p><p>Now there's nothing wrong with companies that make money by offering the technology consumers want. And I'm not saying you as an individual should stop using Apple or Twitter, or that Facebook is evil, or that you as an individual should <a href="http://redecentralize.org/">become a freedom hacker</a>. Maybe Samsung and Vodafone will one day work out that they should spend more money on R&D to stop the dominance of iCloud and Dropbox.</p><p>But I'm not saying this in a disappointed or judgmental way. Everyone is free to work on whatever they choose to work on. I'm just observing that the open tech community should develop the corresponding open technology for each successful proprietary technology, and in this case, we're hugely understaffed.</p><p>If you look at the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/why">reasons people list to work on Indie Web</a>, they all focus on the benefits of having your own website. I think this wiki page has been written like that <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/2012/Positive_Arguments">on purpose</a>, but I still find it striking. I hardly care about having a website myself, I could easily do without it. Apart from keeping up with tech news via Twitter, I have personally never been a big user of the social web. This is not about what I get out of it. The reason I am now starting my own Indie Web site, is because so many non-programmers can't. <em>We programmers are the only doctors on this flight.</em></p><p>There is so much activity in the world that is just concerned with running shops and building houses. A lot of the base luxury, and safety from heat/cold/hunger/thirst/illness/injury, comes from this activity. Billions of people work on running shops and building houses, and that's fine. But then there is the technology boom into which our generation was born. In the future, people will probably look back at our century mainly as when the internet was invented. They will probably look back at our decade as when the iPhone was invented.</p><p>The importance of the current tech boom in the history of humanity is astronomical. And we programmers are the only ones who can change the outcome of this revolution. I have this crazy idea that if you're smart enough to work this out, then it is <em>therefore</em> your responsibility to work on something useful.</p><p>About 0.1% of us who know how to write a computer program and run a server. The other <strong>99.9% of the world population can not choose to join the Indie Web, because they don't possess the skills</strong>. Think about that.</p><p>Of those few million programmers, the vast majority doesn't care about contributing to open technology. That's their fair choice and freedom. But I'm one of the people who, inspired by Eben Moglen's "<a href="http://isoc-ny.org/1338">Freedom in the Cloud</a>" talk and the encouragement of one colleague at the time, said yes, let's give it a go, let's try and save the web. I'm convinced that it's an important task, in the same way a soldier is convinced it's important to represent their nation state in warfare, and a monk is convinced it's important to represent their community in a monastery. It feels like there is a very very very small percentage of people on this earth convinced that they have to save the web. But I'm one of them.</p><p>And that is my reason to continue to work on remoteStorage, and also my reason to join the Indie Web. Not because I want my own website to be indie, but because I  want a world in which a billion websites are indie. Over the past few weeks I worked through levels 1, 2, and 3 of <a href="http://indiewebify.me/">indiewebify.me</a> and <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/indiemark">IndieMark</a> (it's fun! try it!). This weekend I followed the live feed of IndieWebCamp San Francisco and got to know a few of the faces. I subscribed to all your rss feeds. :) At first I will mainly experiment with my own site, but in the long run I aim to set up a non-profit personal hosting provider, offering one-click-install of a range of Indie Web and Personal Cloud servers for non-programmers.</p><p>We need to provide non-programmers with the necessary tools to own their data. We few, who happen to know how to boot up a server, have now had that responsibility fall into our laps. It's like when someone on a plane gets unwell and you happen to be the only doctor on board. Of course you go and try to help out, it's not even a choice. Not doing so would feel like harmful negligence. Even if I'm not a very good doctor, I happen to be on this flight, and I'm proud to get up out of my chair and go see how I can help.</p><p>That is my motivation.</p></div>                    </div>

    </p>
    <p>Sure, the web is full of "silos", but let's not over-dramatize. We can fix this. The web is perfectly capable of supporting social use cases. On the social web there is no clear distinction between information publisher and information consumer: users are generally doing both simultaneously.</p><p>This is easy to implement if all users are publishing (and consuming) at the same domain name. This essay will highlight what I think are the four main topics to address when we want users to communicate with each other seamlessly, even if they happen to be at different domain names. And they are suprisingly simple tricks. Sure, it requires some technology and standards, but much of that already existed a decade ago. The important lessons are in how you design your application for your users.</p><p>The following are four tips for web page providers. If you run a website where people can create a web page (you probably call them "accounts" or "logins"), then this is what you should do to make your website a better participant in the social web:</p><h3>Don't login wall me</h3><p>The first trick is to make public information public, and not put it behind a login wall. Twitter currently allows you to view my web page there (<a href="https://twitter.com/michielbdejong"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/michielbdejong">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>twitter.com/<wbr></wbr>michielbdejong</a>), but if you want to see who I follow (click '<a href="https://twitter.com/michielbdejong/following">following</a>' while not logged in), then you need to log in. Why?</p><p>Quora is <a href="http://www.quora.com/Food/Why-are-bananas-yellow">even worse</a> in this respect, prompting people to log in as a first thing. Why? This means that conversations are drawn into the website where they start, rather than staying decentralized. When I consume public information on Quora or any other website, I should not be forced to log in.</p><p>Consuming limited-audience content can also be implemented without login walls: for instance with unguessable URLs. Picassa used to do this - around a decade ago it was possible to share a Picassa album by sending its URL to someone. Now, the consumer of my photo album is prompted to create a Google account for this. Again: why? All web page providers should switch back to displaying content without login walls.</p><p>Of course, once a web page provider offers its users the ability to <strong>actually publish</strong> content (i.e., without a login wall in front of it), this is big progress compared to what most users get now from their web page provider. And it's an easy win. A next concern is whether the format of this web page follows standards like semantic markup and web feed support. But once web page providers commit to breaking down their login walls, this would then be a small additional step.</p><p>The problem is not that a web page provider like Facebook is unable to engineer a product where you can actually publish stuff, or that there are not enough standards describing how to actually publish something on the web. The power to redecentralize the social web does not lie with engineers, it lies with product managers, who sometimes decide that the ability to actually publish something on the web is not what users need.</p><h3>Don't name space me</h3><p>So removing login walls resolves decentralized <em>consumption</em> of information. Once that works, we only need a few more tricks so that I can also <em>produce</em> content on the web, even if this content is in reaction to existing content elsewhere (for instance when replying to a Quora question). I should be able to do so on my own web page, regardless of who my web page provider is.</p><p>A key concept for this is namespace. Web page providers don't just provide hosting space, they also provide a user interface that allows users to interact with other users. This application is usually namespaced: it will allow you only to interact with users on the same domain name, not with users on other domain names. The buttons, options, and controls of this user interface usually omit the domain name part when identifying other users. For instance, Twitter's @-mention syntax only works when mentioning a user whose web page is also on Twitter.</p><p>StatusNet introduced an important improvement to the @-mention, by changing it to an '@user@host' format. This defaults to a local @-mention when the '@host' part is omitted. Granted, the syntax is maybe not as simple and clean, but in return for that, it is more powerful.</p><p>An important field of research is how such user interactions can be made name space independent. Once web page providers commit to improving their user interfaces in this way, then its technical implementation is not so difficult.</p><p>Of course, there is also the underlying technical question of how a cross-domain @-mention is "delivered": the person being @-mentioned should somehow become aware of this. In fact, it's an engineering task that was already solved for blogs, a decade ago. That is what my third tip is about.</p><h3>Polyglot rel-aware linkback</h3><p>It's not only mentioning or messaging another person which should trigger a cross-domain notification. The same is true for mentioning content. That way, conversations can be threaded together across domains. And hyperlinks are also used in machine-readable data, so there we need something similar too. When my data document represents a move in a chess game, then it will reference the URI of that game with a hyperlink. This idea is the essence of linked data.</p><p>The data document representing the game will also want to link to all the moves that make up the game. How can it do that? My publication of a chess move somehow needs to result in it being linked to from the main data document of the game in which the move occurs.</p><p>Notifying the other document of your link, so that it can link back to you, is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkback">Linkback</a>. The wikipedia page there mentions three protocols. <a href="http://webmention.org/">WebMention</a> is a simplification of Pingback, which recently <a href="http://tantek.com/2013/113/b1/first-federated-indieweb-comment-thread">gained some real-world traction</a>.</p><p>We also have the <a href="http://www.salmon-protocol.org/">Salmon protocol</a> which does the same thing, but using cryptographic signatures. And then there is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/Talks/0320-crosscloud-sandro/#(18)">rdf trackers</a> proposal, which solves the same problem, adding a slightly more powerful query engine than the other five protocols mentioned.</p><p>OK, so that's a problem. Six protocols for linkback? And it will only work if both hosts offer the same one? That would mean as many as 83% of all linkback requests might fail due to incompatibility of the emitting host with the receiving host. How can we solve that?</p><p>We can try to invent a sort of <a href="http://xkcd.com/927/">universal standard</a>, in the same way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto">Esperanto</a> tries to allow people from all nations to communicate with each other. But this would be unlikely to succeed for organizational reasons. And there is a simpler option: make each server support all six linkback protocols, plus any new ones that might pop up.</p><p>If your server speaks all linkback protocols, then even if the other server supports only one of them, the communication will be successful. This works both if you are the emitter and if you are the receiver.</p><p>To make hyperlinks more meaningful, we can use the 'rel' attribute. For instance, my blog post may have a link with rel="author", indicating that it was written by <a rel="author" href="https://michielbdejong.com/">me</a>. A useful link relation for blog posts that are a reply to another blog post is "in-reply-to".</p><p>In rdf, the predicate fulfills this role, for instance 'foaf:knows'. In an ActivityStreams document, each field indicates a relationship, for instance 'actor'. When your server receives a linkback notification for a URI, it can look up in which relation the URI was linked to, and display the hyperlink back to it in a corresponding way.</p><p>Using polyglot rel-aware linkback, adding pages into a specific conversation, chess game, or photo tag list becomes possible on the web.</p><h3>Decentralized search</h3><p>There is however one fourth thing that's needed before the cross-domain experience on the federated social web is as good as the same-origin one: (friend) discovery. Sometimes you want to search a content-addressable index, for instance, searching for a user by name.</p><p>We need a decentralized search index which is publically available, like a phone book, which allows search by name, or by location, or other criteria. This search index cannot be hosted at one single point of failure: several mirrors need to offer an interface to it, and exchange index data with each other. To get started with this, a few existing web page providers could pool their search indexes into one, and publish that index on bittorrent in one or more well-known formats (SQL, csv, xml, json, ...). Anybody could then take this data and instantiate a search engine.</p><p>If we only index rows of "full name, nickname, location, avatar, URL", and create a full-text index on at least the "full name" and "nick name" fields, then typing in the first few letters of a name, could yield a list of full names, with avatars and locations, with each result row linked to a URL. It is then up to the web page owner what they publish on that URL, but at least they will be findable.</p><p>It will probably not be feasible to make the whole web searchable for topics this way, in the way Google Search does, but for the specific domain of friend discovery, this would definitely be doable.</p><p>There are of course important privacy concerns that need to be looked at carefully, and one should only index pages which are intended to be public. Only people who <em>want</em> to be findable on the web should ever end up in this database. And they should have the option of being removed from it; it is up to the ethics of the search provider to only display results from the latest version of the database, and "erase" historic results whenever this is requested. Also, we should make sure that surfacing information that is currently "public but buried" doesn't lead to unintended side-effects.</p><p>But the core question of decentralizing (social) search, stands: if I'm findable on Twitter, then what you see there is already "publically" findable within a specific domain name silo. I then have no problem with also being findable in this decentralized search database.</p></div>                    </div>

    </p>
    <p>This blogpost is a report of a pilot project: "Wifi 4 Change". We wanted to bring free wifi to a poor, traditional village in the
South-East of Turkey and see what happens. At most families in this village, the father would be unemployed for substantial parts of
the year, but have a smartphone and would occasionally buy some prepaid bandwidth when there is money coming in.
The women are generally not allowed to leave the house unless it's necessary for household tasks,
but some of them are allowed to use their husband's phone.</p><p>We successfully installed
the wifi, and just came back from the exciting and unforgettable trip. We learned a lot about the people who live there, and about
the hurdles involved in a small-scale charity project like this.
In about a year or so, we can report about the impact on the educational and commercial
opportunities of the locals which we hope it will have.</p><p>For now, I will try to write up the experience of the installation trip
in such a way that this pilot is now hopefully repeatable:
any backpacker who wants to do something for the people in the area he or she travels through, should be able
to bring free wifi to a village by following this recipe, not giving up, and inventing alternative solutions when things don't go
as planned.</p><p>I can certainly recommend this, and I know there are a lot of travellers out there who would like to do something charitable, but
don't know where to start. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this in a Skype/Hangout/WebRTC call with us, then please feel
encouraged to contact me about this topic!
For instance mention me (<a href="https://twitter.com/michielbdejong">@michielbdejong</a>) on Twitter, or email
michiel at michielbdejong dot com.</p><h2>When internet comes</h2><p>When I first got access to proper internet, this had a huge impact on my life. It was 1993, and I was 18 years old.
I had just switched to a different university.
The reason I switched was that I wanted to have more discussions about topics that fascinated me at the time: the "many worlds" view of
quantum physics, futurology, artificial intelligence, fossil fuel depletion, things like that. Most of my peers were interested in more
common topics of conversation, like sports, or music. The culture at the university where I was, also didn't encourage talking about
anything else. Switching to a university with a different culture partially worked: I found some
friends there who were interested in the same topics as me. So that was great!</p><p>But what I hadn't anticipated was that I would find even better matching discussion partners in cyberspace. The web had only just been
invented, and there were no good search engines yet.
Email was still very much a geek thing. But through the internet forums, I met, for instance, a group of 15 people who
discussed the metaphysical implications of the irreversibility of causality. Some of us were from the US, some from Japan. The closest
person to me interested in that very specific topic was probably at least a thousand kilometers away from me in meatspace, given that there
was only a handful of us on Earth. Thanks to the internet though, we could have passionate discussions about this fascinating topic. I even
"met" Hans Moravec online, the author of one of the futurology books I had been reading.</p><p>You're reading this blogpost on the web, so you know how great it is to have internet access. You also probably know how annoying it is to have
a slow internet connection, one which you have to pay for each time you connect, or one for which you have to ask around to find out who has
the password.</p><h2>The Idea</h2><p>The idea of "Wifi 4 Change" is quite simple: bring free wifi to a place where people need it. One aspect of this free-as-in-freedom, uncensored,
anonymous access to the internet. Some very interesting projects in this area include <a href="http://torproject.org/">Tor</a>,
<a href="http://servalproject.org/">Serval</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>,
the <a href="http://thefnf.org/">Free Network Foundation</a>,
and
<a href="https://gnunet.org/">GNUnet</a>, among of course many others.</p><p>We know there are always forces trying to block each
other and spy on each other; most nation state governments block some services, whether commercial, grass roots, or from competing governments.
Also, most nation state governments spy on individual internet users. This can affect any service and any user, just like shoplifting and bag snatching
are facts-of-life which real-world shops and individuals have to deal with.</p><p>When talking about a "free" internet, one association that comes to mind, is an internet where you can freely use any service you like, no matter
which country you are connecting from, and where you can be free from worries about who is spying on you.
Another aspect is barrier-free access to at least the censored and monitored internet that you and I use every day.</p><p>Important initiatives in the area of barrier-free universal internet access are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_community_network">Wireless Community Networks</a>. Most community wifi projects use a mesh architecture,
which also helps against the problems of centralized blocking and spying on the internet, but here we're mostly interested in the barrier-free access
they provide. Leaders in this area are also for instance
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/Estonia-sets-shining-Wi-Fi-example/2010-7351_3-5924673.html">Estonia</a> (the country), and the EFF-backed
<a href="https://openwireless.org/">Open Wireless</a> movement.</p><h2>Internet in Turkey</h2><p>Although it would already be pretty cool to bring open wifi to for instance Oranienplatz in Berlin (and I'm still hoping the local Pirate Party branch will put
this into their election program one day), for the pilot installation of "Wifi 4 Change", we chose a (predominantly) Kurdish village in the South-Eastern
part of Turkey.</p><p>In Turkey, you have to burocratically
link your mobile phone to your passport or residence permit. As a digital nomad, you can't just get a prepaid SIM card and
use your own phone, like you would in other countries. I'm not sure exactly what the government does with this information of which mobile device belongs to
which citizen.</p><p>When connecting to the wifi network at Starbucks or Caffè Nero, the hotspot service requires you to log in with your Facebook account, giving it access to
the birthdays of all your Facebook friends. Again, I'm not sure what this hotspot provider does with this information, maybe they are under some government
requirement to identify each user up to the point where all internet activity can eventually be linked to a passport number.</p><p>Quite a lot of services are also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Turkey#Blocking_of_Internet_sites">blocked</a> in all of Turkey,
including some of them because they criticize the government. It's nowhere near the government brainwashing you will see in for instance Malaysia, but still,
when you connect to the internet from anywhere in Turkey, the government puts itself inbetween you and the content they don't want you to see.</p><p>Of course, a big worry when setting up open wifi, is if the bill payer will be held responsible for any crimes committed through that connection. Previously
I had been thinking with François about how you could use a Tor relay to make sure no activity would be traced back to the specific open connection.
At the same time this would provide a more free internet access than the local standard.
It would require a lot of engineering and testing however, and would have a cost in terms of connection speed.
So for this pilot, we decided that our priority was to just provide normal, run-of-the-mill, Turkish censored internet.</p><h2>Permission from local and national government</h2><p>While working at <a href="http://yazane.com.tr/">Yazane</a>, a coworking space in Istanbul, I discussed the idea to do this wifi pilot with people there,
and they said it would be easy to get local government on our side, especially if we would stay out of any political issues (presumably referring to the
Kurdish-Turkish conflict). They quoted a successful community project in Van, <a href="http://www.hadd.org.tr/">HADD</a>, which helps minorities to build
a better future for themselves through traditional weaving workshops.</p><p>In Turkey, if you provide internet access (for instance, when you run a coworking space), you need to record the IP addresses your users connect to, and keep
these logs for 6 months. One approach to our project would be to say we're opening a sort of internet cafe, something just like a cafe where wifi is offered.</p><p>Another consideration was that if we work together with the mayor of the village, we could get official permissions to, for instance, put up wifi
repeaters on lantern posts. Cooperation with local government could also bring us some help from their side, for instance, they could install a public computer
in the neighborhood cafe.</p><h2>Involvement of the villagers</h2><p>It turned out that the social structure of the village had an influence on where we could install antennas. After all, the best places are on roofs of houses
or on balconies where they're protected from rain. This will only work if the people are enthusiastic about cooperating.</p><p>In the end, we did not speak to the mayor, but we did involve his candidate successor. This helped to get some local help with the project, and hopefully
the people who helped install the antennas will also maintain them, and repair or replace them if they break.</p><h2>The uplink</h2><p>The first thing you need to bring internet somewhere, is an uplink. There are basically four types: fiber, copper (ADSL), cellular (3G), and satellite.
They deserve preference in that order, based on their price, bandwidth, reliability, and latency. In an affluent urbanized area you would probably always go
for wired, where copper is the most common, and fiber is still relatively rare, at least outside countries like Japan.</p><p>You can research your options for the uplink before you travel to the location; if you don't speak the language of the country (as was the case for us in
Turkey), Google Translate can be used to translate the websites of the country's internet providers (just past the website's address as the text to be translated).
It helps of course if you have a local contact there, and you might even be able to get the uplink sorted out before you travel, so that you can spend all your
time on location on installing the antennas.</p><p>In our case, we had a friend of ours living in the village, which was our main reason to choose this specific village in the first
place. There are about 50 houses there, in an area of about 200x300 meters. Our friend could not convince
TTnet (Turkey's national ISP) to lay a cable all the way to her house though,
since it was too far from the main road. When we arrived, we were luckily able to pick a house which was
much closer to the entrance of the village, and the installers came the next day to install and activate the connection.</p><h2>What the ADSL installers said</h2><p>One thing about this village though, is that it's quite a harsh environment for things like that: the desert brings strong sand winds and temperature
differences. But the environment in this village is also harsh on a social
level: physical objects which you don't actively protect, may eventually get stolen - 
maybe by bored kids who want some pocket money, maybe by people who can't find work and are in debt because they had to buy food. This was one thing we hadn't
really anticipated to that extent.</p><p>We had just installed the first antenna together with the candidate mayor, who still couldn't believe we had come all the way from Berlin to their tiny village
in the desert, to work on this
for free. With a small group of locals we were enthusiastically scouting for a good location to install the second antenna, when the uplink installers from TTnet showed up.
There was an exciting "The A-Team" athmosphere ("<em>I love it when a good plan comes together!</em>"), which quickly disappeared when the TTnet technicians
did not even get out of their car.</p><p>They said they couldn't hang up the necessary wires there because they would just get
stolen for their copper value, and sold to an "eskiye" (second-hand street vendor).
In fact, they had tried to wire up the local medical center several times during the last 5 years,
and each time the cable had been stolen again. The only two points to which a telephone cable existed was the mayor's house (directly at the main road), and the
gas station across the road.</p><p>There was no way we could convince them, and they are the only telephone company in Turkey, so that really smashed our hopes. They drove off, and there we were...</p><h2>Researching alternatives</h2><p>The next day I went to an internet cafe to find out whether we could maybe get satellite access, and how much that would cost. After some comparison, my
conclusion was that it would be possible to set up a satellite uplink, but probably much easier to get a 3G uplink.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to buy a <a href="http://3g-modem.wikifoundry.com/page/Huawei+D100,+D100T">Huawei D-100</a> or similar
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?tag=duckduckgo-d-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=mobile%20hotspot%20device">mobile hotspot device</a>,
which receives a 3G signal and sends out a wifi signal. Such devices don't seem to be available over-the-counter in the region. I don't know if that's because
Turkish law only allows mobile operators to sell them. I had had similar difficulty in the past trying to buy a 3G stick in Istanbul.
In any case, since they are devices that take a SIM card,
you would have to buy them with a Turkish passport or a Turkish residency permit.</p><p>However, of the four 3G providers I compared, two offered a plan that includes mobile hotspot device, and we picked Vodafone
because unlike Turkcell, they actually had one in stock at the nearest shop. :)</p><p>The downside of
<a href="http://www.vodafone.com.tr/Cihazlar/r-201-vodem.php">the device we got</a>
was that it didn't have an ethernet out, so we couldn't link up more antennas to it. In the end, it also turned out we got the 7.2Mbps 3G speed, whereas
<a href="http://cepmerkezi.vodafone.com.tr/handset/yeni-cepte-wi-fi">the other device</a> they had in the shop had the newer 21.3Mbps speed. At Turkcell,
the <a href="">Multivinn</a> would have been 43.2Mbps, but although it's advertised at their website, their shops didn't seem to stock it for some reason.</p><p>I don't know what the impact of 7/21.3/43.2 Mbps is on actual speed during use. The plan we got is limited to 6Gb per month anyway, so in a way, if the
uplink is not superfast, this may actually have the desired effect that people don't watch their videos in HD. :)</p><p>However, if we had known beforehand that we would have to use a 3G uplink, then we could have bought a Huawei D-100 beforehand, and just plug in a wifi stick
on one end, and an ethernet cable on the other. Consider this a tip, if you plan to do a project like this! It would have greatly increased our options when
getting the 3G contract.</p><h2>Connecting the access points</h2><p>We brought three access point devices with us, two times the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?tag=duckduckgo-d-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=ew-7228apn">EW-7228APn</a> from Edimax, and one 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?tag=duckduckgo-d-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=TP-LINK%20TL-WR841N">TL-WR841N</a> from TP-Link.</p><p>These are not ADSL routers, they don't have a modem built in. They only connect ethernet with wifi.
Both cost about 25 euros and can act as both an access point (creating a wifi access point at the end of an ethernet cable), and also as a wifi antenna
(AP client mode), receiving a wifi signal and passing connectivity down the ethernet cable. We hung the Vodafone device high on the wall of one of the
buildings,
where it would have a big open view of the sky to receive the 3G signal, and also a free view of the open space in the village, so that its own wifi signal
comes as far as possible.</p><p>Next to it, we hung up one access point in AP-client mode, and got an ethernet cable (straight, not crossed), down to one of the ground-floor apartments
in the same building. This was enough to have wifi in that entire building, and up to about 50 meters onto the open space around the building.</p><p>We had hoped to get more like 150 meters range, so that we could install our third access point device in repeater mode at about 100m distance, and thus
cover a big chunk of the village area. But I guess these things don't always work as advertised. :)</p><p>Therefore we didn't really get to try out the repeater mode of the Edimax devices. It's based on a store-and-forward protocol called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_distribution_system">WDS</a>.

</p><h2>Impact of the project</h2><p>It was great to see the people use the free wifi. Most of them have a sort of semi-smartphones; not proper Android devices, but still with a touchscreen,
wifi antenna, and Samsung apps. They would generally get some prepaid 3G credit from time to time, to use Facebook or Youtube. So at some level, we brought
them something which they already had.</p><p>But on another level, the way you use the internet is very different when it's open and free, compared to when you pay through your contract to use a little
bit of 3G bandwidth. We cannot yet measure how life in this village will be affected by the presence of free wifi, but we showed the people in the village some
of the things we think they can benefit from. We were there for one week, and in the beginning we showed some of them how to use the shift key and the space bar
on a computer keyboard. During the last days, they really picked up enthusiasm and were logging in, clicking around, and sending emails from their phones.</p><p>Specifically, we helped our friends in this village to set up an e-commerce shop to sell their hand-knitted baby clothes. They are all very good at this,
yet they get very little money for weeks of labor when they sell their creations within their own village, which is of course a very small and poor offset
market. At the same time, they speak very good German.</p><p>Putting this together, we wanted to look for a way to help them sell knitwear in Germany. We helped them research some of the hurdles, like sending goods
to Germany in the mail, and receiving money in euros through a paypal account. Much our week in the village was also spent setting up this first e-commerce shop,
photographing the products, thinking what prices would be reasonable, and writing good product descriptions. And here's the result:
<a href="http://de.dawanda.com/shop/enb-sisters">ENB Sisters</a>. Needless to say, if you're somewhere where they could ship to, and still need some good
Christmas presents, you should of course check it out and buy something from them! :)</p><h2>Project costs</h2><p>We had an unforgettable travel experience, visiting this village for a week. If you are a traveller or a backpacker and enjoy the adventure and joy of
meeting new people who live in places that are different from anything you knew before, then that alone will be worth it. Even if your installation fails.</p><p>In terms of money we spent, the three access point devices together were 80 euros, the mobile hotspot was 30 euros, when bought together with a one-year
contract of 12x 10 euros, and we got the 20m ethernet cable locally at a rural electrics shop (including crimping the connectors onto it, and of course
a glass of Turkish tea while we waited) for 10 euros. So total 80+30+120+10=240 euros for installation and first year of operation.</p><p>Think about that. What charity project can be completed for under 250 euros? If you were to crowd-fund this - put a video up on
<a href="http://indiegogo.com/">IndieGoGo</a> or Kickstarter raising money for it, how long would it take before your friends and Twitter followers would
have reached the target amount? You could even propose to do a journey with 6 villages for 1500 euros. Just putting some ideas in your head, here. ;)</p><h2>In hindsight, lessons learned</h2><p>If you're thinking right now that you might actually
enjoy doing a project like this yourself (which I hope you are!),
here are some things we ourselves would do differently next time. First of all, you need to be careful when
selecting your village. We learned that it helped a lot that we already knew people there, where we could stay, who could translate for us, and who could
introduce us to the other people in the village. A project like this has technical, organizational, social, and also political aspects, which all fit together.
However, you will probably be able to find some help from for instance the hostel where you're staying
nearby, or people you meet on the way. Another thing to keep in mind is that wifi is
probably useless to people who don't have more basic things like electricity or running hot and cold water.</p><p>Check out for instance
<a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=3219">charity:water</a>, and consider which impact you want to make. On the other hand,
I think projects like <a href="http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/">Hole-in-the-Wall</a>,
<a href="http://one.laptop.org/">One Laptop per Child</a> and <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a> help to highlight what can be achieved if people
in remote areas are plugged in to the location-independent opportunities that the internet brings (both in education and in e-commerce).</p><p>In our case we found the village before we found the project: we tried to think what we could do for this village, and came up with installing wifi,
as an experiment. Joining an existing charity project is often harder than you would think it would be. We wanted to try something out by ourselves.
The realization that installing wifi is so ridiculously cheap, when compared to building a drinkwater well or a school building, made
us decide to take on the "wifi 4 change" approach, pack a few access point devices into our backpacks, and face the adventure of personal-scale charity!</p><p>In hindsight, on the technical side, we would have brought a Huawei D-100 device or similar, connecting a standard wifi-stick to the end of a standard
ethernet cable, that would have saved us one wifi device which we now had to use as an AP-client, introducing an unnecessary wifi-to-wifi hop.
We were planning to buy another 3 WDS-capable devices locally, to cover the rest of the area of the village. But it proved harder than we thought to find
good places to install them.</p><p>You can only install a repeater on someone's roof if the people living there will also benefit from it. In our case, one of the points we needed was a
house where the people weren't at home at the time. Also, a repeater in a place where a kid could climb up and steal it (like a lamp post or a low roof)
will also probably not last long, unless you attach it well. In our case, this greatly limited our ability to create better area coverage.</p><p>A good thing to try out next time would also be to bring two or more directional radio antennas, to set up a point-to-point link. These can cover much larger
distances (but be aware you may need to get a permit to install them, because their more powerful radiation beam can cause signal interference).</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>People will tell you they don't believe it will work, that it's not possible, that open wifi will lead to a tragedy of the commons with people taking
more than their share of bandwidth for useless purposes, that you should only give people things they actually ask for themselves, that people in remote
parts of the world don't need our Western, globalization-oriented technology, and that if you really want to change the world, you should either
contribute to a project which gives people something they actually need (food, drinking water, healthcare, schools, etcetera), or start with yourself and
improve the world in your own home environment.</p><p>Some of this advice may be right, I don't know. Other people always know better what you should be doing
instead. In the end, you have listen to the advice prior to taking your decision, then pick your battle, and go for it. From that point on you should be selective in what advice you
accept, and believe in your own plan. For us, in this case, and hopefully also for you next time you plan to travel somewhere, this plan is to install

            </h2>
            <p class="reading">
        <span class="vague">9 min read </span>
    </p>
    <p><em>from the unpublished 2013 reboot issue of <a href="http://one-two-one-two-microphone-check.com/">OTOTMC</a></em></p><h2>Chinese New Year</h2><p>As a digital nomad, I happened to be in Kuala Lumpur this month. Malaysia has filled its capital
  with many huge shopping malls, and for the Chinese
  New Year celebration, these prestigious temples of consumerism are all decorated around
  the fascinating theme of <em>prosperity</em>.</p><p>Wishing your peers a prosperous new year
  seems like a fitting thing to do inside a shopping mall where all
  memories of the warm and humid forest are freeze-dried away by
  proudly expensive air-conditioning. It somehow
links the concept of success to the concept of wealth.</p><p>Human societies have a hierarchy of power ranks, that allow them to
function more efficiently. These ranks are often assigned based on success, whether
this is success at accumulating resources, or success in directly fighting opponents in some sort of
verbal or physical warfare.</p><p>Wealth is a way to measure success and establish ranks in our society. If everybody pursues wealth, then wealth can act as a points system
  to see who is more successful and should be assigned more power. This creates a game where the goal is to accumulate wealth.</p><h2>Our gamified lives</h2><p>Everybody loves games. Especially we "professionals" can get so focused on our carreer that we even define a big
  part of our identity based on it. And our carreers have been gamified into a ladder game:
if you work hard enough, you will be able to reach a position in which you will have
a higher rank, earn more money, will probably have to work even harder, etcetera.</p><p>It is not only our carreer paths that have been gamified. Building up wealth is also a game
in itself, where each dollar is a point in the game. Simply owning a big house or a big car is a goal
in itself in our gamified lives.</p><p>But in the past, this game made sense, and there was actually a desirable prize to win.
  We used to have to work hard in order to obtain luxury. You had to buy 6 expensive audiophile devices
  in order to copy a record onto a cassette tape, and it would still sound shitty.</p><p>You needed a VHS recorder and
a Cannon Ray Tube television, and then you needed furniture to house all these devices, and then a bigger house, with space for all
this furniture. And before you could record video, you needed to save up for a CamCorder. Flights were expensive
    too, and they were sold in inefficient high street shops. Even simple things like non-stick frying pans were
expensive to buy.</p><p> This made the prosperity game challenging
    and fun. But all these things are now cheap. The fact that we can now have great luxury for much less money, hollows out the whole incentive
  and prize structure
  of the prosperity ladder. It undermines the whole game we have all been playing since the rise of consumerism.</p><h2>Virtual luxury</h2><p>Nowadays, a virtual form of luxury is within reach of a growing percentage of people on Earth.
    A laptop is much more light-weight, and much more attainable than your hi-fi
cabinet from 20 years ago, but it gives you a much higher level of luxury. Once you have a laptop and some good
headphones, you just need a daypack with some clothes, a passport and a toilet bag, and you are free. The light-weight, virtual luxury
of a digital nomad is something that was impossible a few decades ago.</p><p>Especially if you have the freedom to work remotely, which for
most professionals should be obtainable if you just take the effort to organize it, then you can have immense luxury
for very little money.</p><p>And it not only applies to programmers traveling through
South-East Asia. You can also just live in a cheap area of Berlin and share a flat with some other virtual professionals like
musicians, actors and fashion designers. As e-commerce and mechanical automation continue to make our world ever more efficient,
  less people will have to work in travel agencies and coal mines, and more people are now able to live as "creatives", creating art work
  that does not rely on any physical resources.</p><p>Obviously, working remotely
is an essential pre-requisite of virtual luxury. If your job or the people you love tie you to Munich or Manhattan, then your life
  is not going to be cheap, and a percentage of the world population will always work on farms and in factories. But the option of escaping the
  money game will become
  obtainable for a growing number of people, at least during some part of their life.</p><p>If you have all your projects on your laptop, then
    you no longer have to commute to an office, you no longer need a car. Or an office. Or even a highway. The point is: online life
  is infinitely more resource-efficient than the physical life we were restricted to a few decades ago. In the online world, people interact
    much more as hippie artists, enjoying prosperity without spending money.</p><p>And the less
  money you spend, the less your worries about carreer opportunities will weigh down on your freedom, and the more luxury you will enjoy.
  Your social status will be much more influenced by the art works you are proud of, and much less by your prosperity.</p><h2>Rebooting the game</h2><p>This shift is a huge shock to how society is organized. It's starting to reboot the game by undermining its incentive structure.
You can't play a game if you don't care about winning.</p><p>Prosperity, that intriguing mix between success and wealth, will become less and less important as a ladder system
for people who will simply all have "enough" points in the game. Because once you achieve virtual prosperity, there is no challenge in
achieving enough money to live the way you want to.</p><p>Your spending choice will be limited by how much you can eat and which ecological footprint you want to morally allow yourself. Not by whether or not you have
enough money left. This is currently true for a small percentage of global society, but that percentage will only grow as the price of virtual prosperity
continues to drop, and conciousness about the ecological consequences of consumerism continues to rise.
Therefore, wealth will cease to be the primary organizing structure of our society.</p><p>One big difference is how you interact with the people around you. As you focus less on materialism, and money becomes less relevant to you, your
ability to impress people with the brand of your car or your watch will disappear. At the same time you will probably be less impressed by the wealth of other
    people you meet.</p><p>Of course Lamborghini cars will not lose their appeal overnight. And much of the pamper-power of a Starbucks coffee would be lost if it wasn't
    overprized.
    But as more of our productivity has been virtualized into cyberspace, so has parts of our consumption and of our social status. A concept of
    "virtual prosperity" is starting to take shape.</p><p>As a programmer for instance, your social "rank" is measured
much more by the number of people watching your github repos than by your job title in a money-job or your wealth in the physical world.
    Online respect, clout, and reputation are the new "points system" for our gamified lives.

  </p><h2>Decentralized global government</h2><p>I think we will see, within our lifetimes, the dawn of a
web-based global government, that will make the paper-based (and often money-based) governments largely obsolete.</p><p>Here in Malaysia for example, it is the government who has claimed ownership of the rainforest and is now
  <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/agriculture/palm_oil/environmental_impacts/forest_conversion/">selling it</a> to commercial companies
for money. There is a rumour there will be elections in the first half of 2013, but television stations are
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Malaysia">not allowed to broadcast</a> speeches by opposition leaders.</p><p>I think the
  web is our best hope to fight money-driven corruption and improve democracy in such an environment. Through this open and free platform,
  bloggers as well as readers can
  "vote" for or against brands, campaigns, and causes. Through the web, we will know exactly under which conditions certain goods were produced, and branding
  becomes ever more decentralized.</p><p>Big brands now have to engage
in dialog with individual activist bloggers.
  This makes the web into a decentralized global government, that didn't exist twenty years ago.
  And since the web is not owned by anyone, it is starting to give us the democracy we need, to establish a global human society of fair trade and protected commons.</p><p>As money becomes less important in our choices as humans, the power of money-based companies becomes less, and the collective power of humans
  increases. Money will no longer be able to hire us
just by offering a high salary. Humans will be free to make the choices they believe in, without having to give up their always-sufficient luxury and prosperity.</p><p>After we have bought all the things we need during a day, we will have excess buying power left over to donate to the World Wildlife Fund, or to choose for certified
fair trade and ecologically sourced products.</p><p>It is hard to say what our society will look like in 50 years. But as money becomes less important to humans, nation state governments and the wars they fight
  will hopefully become less important in our everyday lives. The rise of online society will not change the definition of success and power,
  nor how these concepts affect human interaction, and there will always be inequality and conflicts.</p><p>But because in the online world the basic resources can be copied indefinitely without depleting, and there are infinite amounts of space to squat,
    the concepts of wealth and "prosperity" will likely get a
  very different meaning during the reboot our society is going through right now.</p><p><em>Michiel de Jong is a nomadic programmer and a co-unorganizer of the <a href="http://2013.unhosted.org/">Unhošť unhosted unconference</a>,

            </h2>
            <p class="reading">
        <span class="vague">11 min read </span>
    </p>
    <p>The countries are a group of about 200 organizations which work against each other, and sometimes with each other,
        in an attempt to both prevent and exert crime. Let’s define crime, very roughly, as aggression against humans
        or against their property.</p><p>Humans are born with a sense of ‘home’, that is, a geographical area that is considered relatively safe from crime. Since there is a limited
        amount of geographical area on earth, and sometimes different people prefer the same specific area to use as their home, crime is sometimes used against
        other people in an attempt to establish one’s own safe home area. This is then what we call a border dispute, or a war.</p><p>People group together to establish home areas of different sizes, and these groups form bigger groups with bigger home areas, but the countries form a set
        of 200 such groups which together cover the whole planet, yet rarely overlap. When I use the phrase ‘the countries’, I mean not countries as a
        concept, but specifically this group of 200 countries that currently exists on Earth. </p><p>What makes the countries different from smaller areas they contain, like provinces, and larger areas they are contained in, like for instance the European
        Union is that most countries recognize most other countries as sovereign states, that is, they will not try to interact with each other if not through mutually
        beneficial trade.</p><p>For this reason, the borders between the countries are particularly important, and most border disputes are between two or more of them, rather than between,
        say, provinces. There are also country-level crimes (wars) between countries that are not border disputes,  but rather monopoly disputes (oil is a prime
        example).</p><p>Where the sovereignty of countries is not complete, crimes can exist at a multi-country level. For instance during the cold war, blocks of countries were using
        crime against each other to each try to secure their own multi-country safe home area. Many countries have organized systems of internal power through which
        people can gain influence and property, the two of which in itself often lead to crime and retaliation within a country.</p><p>Let’s not start from the assumption that everything that happens on this planet happens in one of the countries. Let’s consider the countries as
        organizations that exist but that are metaphysically equivalent to any other form of organization between people. This leads us to observe that throughout our
        lives, we are likely to interact with some of the countries for three reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>moral obligation</strong>: even though the countries are not by themselves morally significant entities, the fact that they exist and are        
          recognized by people raises a moral obligation to recognize them as organizations with which we interact. Just like there is a moral obligation to 
          pay money to shops when you take things from them.</li>
        <li><strong>social obligation</strong>: the people we interact with will expect and want us to recognize the countries that they also recognize.</li>
        <li><strong>causal consequence</strong>: if we don’t abide by the rules of countries with which we interact, then either the police or the army
          of that country will probably consider that a crime, and retaliate.</li>
      </ol><p>So in which ways do we interact with countries? There are also three ways for this:</p><ol><li><strong>location</strong>: most countries agreed non-overlapping claims to geographical area with most other countries. In some cases, two countries claim a certain
          location as their safe home zone, and sometimes a country occupies part of another country, in which there is one occupied and one occupying country. There are only very
          few and small areas that are not claimed by any country (for instance tax free zones at airports and border crossings). This means that at any moment we are probably in
          the safe home zone of one country, and sometimes in more than one or in the occupied zone of a second country. Most countries publish rules of behaviour for humans who
          are located in their safe home zones, and we are encouraged by moral obligation, social obligation, and causal consequence, to follow those rules.</li>
        <li><strong>habitual residence</strong>: when you reside for a significant time in the safe home zone of a country (more than about 60 days on end, or
          more than 180 days in a year, or whatever limit the country sets), then you are obliged to register with that country as a habitual resident. Unless you move around a
          lot, it’s hard to avoid being a habitual resident of at least one country. But it also often has useful benefits to be a habitual resident of at least one country.
          More about this later.</li>
        <li><strong>nationality</strong>: most countries require you to register as a national of at least one country, even if you stay in their safe home zone for only one
          minute. But unlike with the habitual residence registration, they usually allow you to register with one of the other countries, especially if you only stay in their
          safe home zone for a short time. It’s usually not trivial to register as a national though, unless you are born in the country’s safe home zone, or at
          least one of your parents is a national of the country you’re registering with. Most people are only registered with one country, usually the country in whose
          safe home zone they were born. Although most countries will let you enter their safe home zone as long as you are registered as a national with at least one of the
          other countries, some countries may refuse to register you as a habitual resident unless you are also registered as a national of that same country. Most countries
          will allow you to stay in their safe home zone indefinitely if you’re registered as a national with them, provided you then
          also register as a habitual resident.</li>
      </ol><p>Once you are registered as a national of at least one country, and if you don’t stay in any one country’s safe home zone for extended periods of
        time, and don’t form a productive and localized part of the internal economy or commit any crime in any of their safe home zone, the countries usually
        leave you alone. You will have to deal with some paperwork and maybe pay some money each time you move from one country’s safe home zone to
        another one’s, but
        at least as you don’t overstay your welcome in any of them, and are registered as a national with at least one of them, none of the countries
        will probably oblige you to become a habitual resident with them.</p><p>Being a country’s habitual resident will oblige you (again, in the three ways, morally, socially and through causal consequence) to hand over about
        a quarter of your income to that country’s organization. Here ‘income’ is a bit hard to define, but let’s not discuss that
        here; the point is, being a country’s habitual resident costs a lot of money. But as I said before, most countries offer benefits in return. The main
        ones are:</p><ul><li>free or cheaper education</li>
        <li>free or cheaper health care</li>
        <li>free or cheaper right to stay in the country’s safe home zone indefinitely</li>
        <li>free or cheaper unemployment insurance</li>
        <li>free or cheaper disability insurance</li>
        <li>free or cheaper pension</li>
        <li>charity in your name (paying the above things also for people poorer than you)</li>
      </ul><p>Very poor people rely on the charity of other members of the country where they are habitually resident to pay for their costs. If they would not be members
        of any country, they might not be able to afford education or health care. But could someone who earns at least average income do without those, and
        organize them herself without going through any of the country for it?</p><p>Of course you would have to change safe home zones regularly, so as not to fall under any country’s obligation to register as a habitual resident.
        That can be easy though, often you only have to cross the border for a ‘visa run’ every few months. You would have to organize your own education,
        which probably means your children’s education. This can easily be done with a student loan and/or some savings. You can also save up your own pension
        if you’re disciplined enough not to spend it prematurely, and charity to people who are poorer than you is also easily organized.</p><p>Unemployment insurance is a strange concept about which I could write a whole separate post. Its very concept regards humans as employees rather than as
        autonomous agents. If you’re not disabled, then you can work. Maybe you will have to become a fisherman or a cleaner, but if you’re the
        slightest bit resourceful, you will not die from hunger as long as you are able to do valuable work.</p><p>That leaves health care insurance and disability insurance. You can get international cover for those while travelling away from your country of habitual
        residence (for instance <a href="http://www.healthcareinternational.com/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.healthcareinternational.com/<wbr></wbr></a> ) but I have yet to find an insurance that offers these without that requirement. More than
        a requirement, it is an assumption actually that, surely, you are registered as a habitually resident with at least one of the countries.</p><p>Many people are not registered as habitual residents with any of the countries, but then they probably also have no health care insurance anywhere.
        I am interested in setting up a private transnational insurance for nomads. Many people conduct their business online now, culture is becoming more
        globalized, and long-distance travel is becoming more and more affordable. This means that the countries are starting to lose their value proposition
        as providers of nationality registration and of habitual resident rights packages.</p><p>Of course we need government and law enforcement, but they can be organized on a local scale at various hierarchical levels. For instance if you
        live in Barcelona, the law is prescribed and enforced by the owners association (‘comunidad’) of your building, maybe a neighborhood
        watch, the city council, the autonomous region of Catalunya, the country whose safe home zone it lies in (Spain), and the European Union. This works well,
        and the country does not necessarily need to have a special status within this line-up.</p><p>If countries allow registered nationals of all other countries to enter their safe home zone temporarily (with a tourist visa), then they might as well
        allow in all humans. This means countries should extend tourist visas to humans who enter their safe home zone with for instance an identity
        card of a <a href="http://www.utnr.net/" title="transnational republic">transnational republic</a>. Within the euro zone, countries already
        stopped enforcing their border controls.</p><p>The reason people want to keep borders up is often because many of them feel unsafe around people who are different from them (a phenomenon known
        as xenophobia). We can use the word foreigner to describe someone who is not a national of the country whose safe zone she resides in. I myself for
        instance have been a foreigner for over 10 years now.</p><p>Many people suffer from xenophobia, and are afraid of foreigners in general. They experience the presence of a foreigner in their safe zone as an
        intrusion. The sense of intrusion makes them feel unsafe from crime, and they also often fear their property is unsafe from crime (ah, property…).
        In the end, the countries exist to make the inhabitants of their safe zones feel safe from crime. Personally, I think the concept of trying to lock
        down humans into geographical safe zones because of assumptions about regional crime levels is ripe for a good rethink.</p><p>It’s ironic that the countries have often established their existence using crime against human members of other countries, then tend to
        define their own rules by making deviation from them a crime for their citizens, and finally also stay in existence because the inhabitants of
        their safe zones fear crimes against what they consider their property.</p><p>But my main point is: Let me know if you know of any private personal insurance systems that do not require you to have a country of habitual
        residence. If we have that then we can found a Nomad Nation: a transnational republic that offers a voluntary social welfare system which allows
        you to live your life without relying on the countries.</p></div>                    </div>

    <h2>My field is “Informatics”</h2><p>I usually tell people I’m a programmer, but that describes my job, not my field. The thing I studied for at uni is “computer science”,
        or “informatics” as I like to call it. It is a field of science, and is not to be confused with the field of technology called
        “programming” or “software engineering”, or indeed also “computer science”. The language in which informatics was
        taught to me includes such constructs as the Turing machine, formal grammars, finite state machines, graphs, and expressions. In a way, this language
        influences how we understand the topics we study. So even though people may say it’s useless to say the same thing in a different language than
        the one it’s already been said in, I think it deepens our understanding of a subject if we describe it in different words. So this blogpost
        describes informatics in my words.</p><h2>The basis: Booleans</h2><p>Booleans are variables that maybe true or false. They are an important building block of everything else in informatics. When we talk about information
        in informatics we usually assume that this information is represented as a string of 0s and 1s. It is possible to represent information using more than
        two digits or letters, but Shannon’s Theory of Information explains that information can always be translated into a stream of 0s and 1s, so for
        simplicity’s sake, we usually assume we deal with Boolean (or ‘binary’) variables. A valuation of variables “p, q, …”
        can be any sequence of 0s and 1s that has one digit per variable. For instance:</p><p>p q r</p><p>0 1 0</p><p>A truth table can describe a function, so it is more powerful: it assigns a 0 or a 1 to each possible valuation, for instance:</p><p>p q r value</p><p>0 0 0 1</p><p>0 0 1 0</p><p>0 1 0 1</p><p>0 1 1 0</p><p>1 0 0 0</p><p>1 0 1 0</p><p>1 1 0 1</p><p>1 1 1 1</p><h2>Rewriting expressions</h2><p>A state of knowledge about a list of such Boolean variables can be written as a stream of 0s and 1s, but to give a better insight into the interrelation
        of the variables,
        and also because it’s often shorter, we often use Boolean expressions. These consist of variable names “p, q, …” and operators
        “NOT(…)”, “(… AND …)” and “(… OR …)”. Here are some examples of expressions that are
        equivalent to the
        truth table mentioned earlier:</p><p>((p AND q) OR (NOT(p) AND NOT(r)))</p><p>(NOT((p OR r) AND (NOT(p AND q))))</p><p>As you can see in this example already, one truth table can be equivalent to several different expressions. These expressions are interpreted by us humans
        to mean
        ‘AND’, ‘NOT’ and ‘OR’ in their real-world meanings, but the
        way they are defined in informatics is only behavioural. They are defined
        in terms of how the resulting expression corresponds to a truth table. Mathematicians will tell you that this is
        on purpose; the system of expressions is defined as a
        mathematical abstraction, not in relation to real-world phenomena which we map it onto.</p><p>When computer programs run, or we make logical deductions using pencil and paper, no information is added during the process. Information might be removed,
        when some of
        the information that the process started with is forgotten or thrown away halfway through, but that is optional. The information is only being reorganized.
        So reasoning,
        the running of computer programs, is rewriting expressions. In fact, 3-SAT, one of the most famous computation tasks in informatics, can be solved by
        rewriting an expression from Product-of-Sums form “(a OR b OR c) AND (d OR e OR f) AND …” to Sum-of-Products form “(a AND b AND c)
        OR (d AND e AND f) OR …”. Running an algorithm (or reasoning about Boolean information) is a process in time: it is a process of abstract
        represented states through time, that has its counterpart in the physical world, of a machine changing its physical status through time.</p><p>This is why I don’t feel this rewriting of Boolean expressions is a good way to model reasoning. It does not take advantage of the fact that on the
        one hand AND, OR and NOT have a meaning in our real world, and on the other hand so does time, and duration. Maybe it is because of abstracting so much from
        these real-world phenomena, that we still haven’t been able to prove what is arguably the central point of informatics: that ‘hard’
        algorithmic tasks (problems that are in NP but not in P), exist. In other words, we haven’t been able to formalize properly that logical processes
        fundamentally take time.</p><p>We just observe that computation takes time, but leave the question of why this is so to philosophers. I like philosophy. In fact, I think the philosophical
        implications of informatics are even more fascinating than the technological ones. Informatics is at the stage where biology was before Darwin: biologists
        were studying species, but not their origin. In informatics, we are studying computational complexity, but we do not study its origin. Hence the title of
        this blogpost. :)</p><h2>Causality</h2><p>In the real world, we are familiar with causality: the future is partially unpredictable, meaning there are several candidate outcomes for the future,
        when viewed from the present.  In quantum physics such uncertainty is sometimes called superposition, but we know it also as the logical ‘OR’
        operator (real semantic ‘OR’ this time, not the syntactical ‘OR’ from Boolean expressions).</p><p>Causality is the relationship between cause and effect. It describes how causes in the relative past interrelate with effects in the relative future.
        Memory (retaining information from the past) is part of the same relationship between past and present as causality.</p><p>Unlike the future, the past can be remembered, meaning information accumulates. Knowing several things at the same time is what we know as the
        semantic ‘AND’ operator. Accumulating multiple bits of information this way is exactly what an algorithm does when it ‘runs’.
        It converts ‘OR’ information (future) into ‘AND’ information (past). Moving the present forward into the future, while putting
        the past behind you, is what we know as the passing of time. Although not everybody realises this, and many people will give a more mundane definition
        of informatics, this is what informatics is about - at least for me. It studies this fascinating relationship between information and time.</p><h2>Knowledge items</h2><p>To express the fact that we are accumulating knowledge, we need to interpret the syntactical ‘AND’ operator from our Boolean expressions as the
        semantic ‘AND’ of causality/memory. This means the entries in a truth table should be treated as collectable items. I call them knowledge items.
        You can collect them, and they add up to your knowledge. You can throw them away if you don’t need them anymore. This is exactly what an algorithm will
        generally attempt to do when it is rewriting expressions: accumulate useful knowledge items, which are arguments of the expression’s outer ‘AND’
        operator.</p><p>At the same time, an algorithm will attempt to resolve uncertainty by resolving ‘OR’ terms. Note that the total information state does not change.
        The algorithm’s knowledge about the thing it’s modeling (the problem instance) does not change during the process. So in a way, when you give a
        problem instance to a reasoning machine, you could say the machine already ‘knows’ the answer when it starts. It does not receive any further
        information from the outside during the reasoning process. It is only rewriting the information into a format that, as time advances, has more ANDs and
        less ORs.</p><p>In a truth table, the zeroes are the knowledge points. This is because when you combine two truth tables with the ‘AND’ operator, the resulting
        truth table is found by putting a zero wherever there was one in at least one of the earlier truth tables. The ones are irrelevant in this process, look:</p><p>p q r a b a AND b</p><p>0 0 0 1 1 1</p><p>0 0 1 <strong>0</strong> 1 <strong>0</strong></p><p>0 1 0 1 1 1</p><p>0 1 1 <strong>0</strong> 1 <strong>0</strong></p><p>1 0 0 1 <strong>0 0</strong></p><p>1 0 1 1 <strong>0 0</strong></p><p>1 1 0 1 1 1</p><p>1 1 1 1 1 1</p><p>So the zeroes in a truth table are the knowledge items we collect as time progresses.</p><h2>Non-deterministic deduction</h2><p>A logical deduction is a linear sequence of collections of knowledge items. At each step, new knowledge items can be formed from ones that are already in the
        collection, using for instance the ‘AND’ operator as shown in the last example. The choice of
        which knowledge items to combine next, is not part of this
        process. The deduction is an exact path - a proof, not an algorithm. The class of NP problems are problems
        whose instances are solved by such proofs, such that the
        number of steps in the proof is polynomial in the length of the description of the problem instance. Polynomial
        means that the way the length of the shortest proof
        increases, is bounded above by a function that is a polynomial function of the length of the description of
        the problem instance. For instance if the length of the
        proof is never greater than the number of bytes in the problem instance description, to the power of 7,
        then we say the problem’s non-deterministic computational
        complexity is O(n^7).</p><p>But non-deterministic algorithms are pretty useless to engineers. they don’t tell you which recipe to follow
        to arrive from question to answer. They are only the
        proofs of logical deductions, not the reasoning processes that lead to obtaining these proofs.</p><h2>Deterministic tree traversal</h2><p>To obtain a proof, one option is depth-first tree traversal: simply try out all possible proofs until you find one that answers the question you wanted to answer. But
        usually, algorithms will use a combination of trying out options (elements of an ‘OR’ operator in the logical expression that we are rewriting), and
        heuristics: strategies that are a function from the current collection of knowledge items, to a choice of which step to take next.
        These heuristics are what we express
        in computer programs.</p><p>Since usually the expression we are rewriting contains a lot of ‘OR’ operators, and there is no way to try out all possible options without
        ‘visiting’ them, deterministic algorithms often take exponential time
        in the length of the description of the problem instance. Exponential functions grow
        a lot faster than polynomial functions, which is why even on fast computers, some computations can take seconds,
        or hours, or years, depending on how big the logical
        expression is that the computation rewrites.</p><h2>The relation between time and logic</h2><p>Nobody in informatics has so far been able to prove that solving problems like 3-SAT is fundamentally impossible to do in polynomial time. It will be up to the
        smart theorists to keep trying to come up with a demonstration that P is not NP. This is one of the reasons informatics is not always recognized as a
        ‘science’ that studies phenomena like information and time in a semantic way. Instead, our field is often categorized a mere result of mathematics
        rather than a science that studies something: just modeling, in a syntactical way without interpreting the results as part of our real-world surroundings.</p><p>That’s why I hope that with this blogpost I’ve been able to share some of my fascination for my field of science. We are Informatics. We study
        the relation between time and logic.</p></div>                    </div>
